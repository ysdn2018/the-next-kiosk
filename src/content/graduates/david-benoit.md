intro: >-
  Perception and how it is unique to all of us is something we might not always think about and fully understand. For this book trailer based on Sputnik Sweetheart a Novel by Haruki Murakami, I wanted to show how an intense love triangle can be seen by each of the characters in a series of brief visual capsules.
