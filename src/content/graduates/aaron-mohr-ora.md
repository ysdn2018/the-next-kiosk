intro: >-
  ORA is a multi-dimensional music project by Rosy Glow. The project consists of a 4-song EP with an accommodating web application that allows users to remix different musical components of the album within their browser. The concept behind the project was to blur the lines between the user and the artist and generate an interface where anyone can experience the process of producing music.
