intro: >-
  In looking at ways we can communicate non verbally, I created a visual language of dance by using elements of design, to recreate a new meaning and interpretation to how we can visualize movement. This was explored as an animated Gif, showing the differentiation between ballet, modern contemporary and jazz, as forms of expression explored using movement.
