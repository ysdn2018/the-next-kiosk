intro: >-
  Pulse FF is a film festival for the horror and suspense genre. The video is an introduction sequence to the festival that would play as promotional material and as a short clip before each feature movie is screened. By slowly layering and building different sounds, and creating a unique pattern shift for each one, there is a growing sense of unease and trepidation until the climax is reached.
