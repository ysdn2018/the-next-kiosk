intro: >-
  Visual culture has constructed a perception of the nonhuman animal as inherently lesser, justifying our violence towards them. The “Wild Things Are” project synthesizes and visualizes the main themes of animal ethics discourses, inviting the contributions of creative minds, striving to inspire a new concept of animality beneficial to all life on Earth, human and nonhuman alike.
