intro: >-
  ARSight is a speculative wearable Augmented Reality system for the visually impaired to help navigate everyday life. As the current technology is not yet available, this software demonstrates how the technology of AR can be used to auditorily assist the visually impaired. With new technologies such as AR and VR, designers must create with accessibility at the forefront of their design process.
