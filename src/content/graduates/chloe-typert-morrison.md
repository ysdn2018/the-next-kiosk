  Aegis is a wearable protection device that addresses the fear of crime and rape in women and allows them to feel secure no matter where they are. The device is built into underwear and works on a tap to text system to send an alert and location to her chosen contacts, local authorities, school security, and venue security to ensure the closest people to the user are contacted and can help.
