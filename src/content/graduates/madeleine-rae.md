intro: >-
The NutriLab kit and mobile application is a system designed to help combat the growing issue of nutrient deficiency in people. Using micro-technology, I have created a device that has the capabilities to screen for 8 of the most common nutrient deficiencies. This device connects to a mobile application which provides an analysis of the blood sample, in order to allow the user to ensure their nutrient levels are healthy.
