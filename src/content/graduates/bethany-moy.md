intro: >-
  Ways of Seeing is an ode to John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing” which critically evaluates human’s ability to see and perceive. The viewer is taken into four episodes and seven chapters of Berger’s deconstructed theories through a series of collaborative mini interactions. The site acts as an interactive archive of people’s different “ways of seeing” which viewers can continue to add to and explore.
