intro: >-
  The current process for post-secondary students to talk with a professional counsellor at school is draining as the waiting time could last longer than four weeks. Hug is designed to help students book counseling appointments online and keep them occupied during the wait. It is also an online platform for students who are experiencing mental health distress to connect with each other.
