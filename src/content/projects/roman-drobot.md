  A Fashion Film Directed by Roman Drobot

  Although I am a designer with no professional background in film, I wanted to challenge myself to apply what I have learned in this program across other disciplines and put design thinking to the test.

  I am proud to present my York/Sheridan Design BDes Honours thesis, shot in collaboration with fashion brands MAILROOM and LFNT with Westin Nguyen behind the camera, and with the help of Kaitlin Macapagal and a wonderful team who believed in my vision. This has been one of the most enriching and creative adventures I have been on. 

  I have long been fascinated with the free-form medium of fashion film, and it has been a dream of mine to one day shoot one myself. That day has finally come.

  A massive thank you to everyone involved; this project is as much yours as it is mine.
