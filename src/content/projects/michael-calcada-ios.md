intro: >-
  Everyone uses an iPhone differently, people have different apps, needs, and ways they use and interact with their phone. I propose iOS should be redesigned to fix the lack of personalization and give users the ability to customize their phone as they see fit. I also believe redesigning iOS with Augmented Reality and Siri at the core of the OS will allow for new innovative ways to use an iPhone.
