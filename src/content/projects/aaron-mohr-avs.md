intro: >-
  AVS001 is an installation that allows for the generation of randomized musical sequences. The concept behind this project arose from the idea of creating computer generated music. I wanted to eliminate the choice factor of music making in order to make the process both accessible and incidental. By allowing the computer to algorithmically determine how the notes are played, the user is able to experience beautiful mistakes which might not have been reached organically.
