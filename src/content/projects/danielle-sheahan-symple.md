intro: >-
  One of the biggest challenges for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is being able to recognize and cope with symptoms such as flashbacks, insomnia, and panic attacks. SYMPLE gives people more control over their mental health by enabling them to anticipate, manage, and track their PTSD symptoms. The app is designed to accompany a wearable smart device that monitors the individualâ€™s physical and mental health.

  Image 1: Anticipate Symptoms: Symple allows individuals to monitor unique risk factors such as isolation, inactivity, and fatigue, and it suggests actions they can take to reduce their risk of experiencing a symptom.

  Image 2: Track Symptoms Over Time: Symple also allows individuals to document the frequency and severity of their symptoms over time, enabling them to observe patterns and track progress.

  Image 3: Manage Symptoms in Real Time: If the user experiences a symptom the app takes them through a sequence which asks them a few simple questions and provides them with some customized coping mechanisms to help them get through the episode.
