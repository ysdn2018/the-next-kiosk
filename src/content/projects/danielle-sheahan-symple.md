intro: >-
  One of the biggest challenges for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is being able to recognize and cope with symptoms such as flashbacks, insomnia, and panic attacks. SYMPLE gives people more control over their mental health by enabling them to anticipate, manage, and track their PTSD symptoms. The app is designed to accompany a wearable smart device that monitors the individualâ€™s physical and mental health.
