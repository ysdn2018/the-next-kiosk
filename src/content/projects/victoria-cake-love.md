intro: >-
  As a child, my grandmother instilled in me a love and appreciation of
  nature. She had African violets on every windowsill and even established
  a community garden for the residents. The reason why I was drawn to the
  Allan Gardens Conservatory is because of the history and the legacy
  behind this historic garden - much like the legacy left by my
  grandmother.
