  Clear is a digital project that harnesses ephemerality as a digital tool to aid with mental health. Using cognitive-behavioural principles such as release writing, this mobile and tablet application aims to encourage users to vent and let go of burdening thoughts that impact overall well-being by using the power of journaling.
