  This piece uses expressive typography to visualize the voice of a deaf woman and her struggles as being hearing-impaired. It illustrates the social need for increasing fluency in sign language among the general public to foster human connection.

  This video was made to support Wave; a video game and mobile app for breaking communication barriers through the education of sign language.
